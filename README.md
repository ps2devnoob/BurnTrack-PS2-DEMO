Before diving into the details of this project, I would like to extend a big thank you to **Daniel Santos** for creating the incredible engine **AthenaEnv** and for continuously improving it every day. Thanks to his work, homebrew development for the **PlayStation 2** has become more accessible and powerful.

## About the Project

This is a **demonstration** of a car game using **AthenaEnv**. The main objective of this project is to **teach** and demonstrate the capability of creating games for the **PlayStation 2** using this engine.

The project serves as a foundation for learning, allowing developers to explore concepts such as:

- 3D rendering
- Camera manipulation
- Controls and movement

## Requirements

To run this demo, you need:

- If you are opening it on PlayStation 2, just open the `.elf` file normally through uLaunchELF.
- If using PCSX2, you need to activate **hostfs** and open the elf.
